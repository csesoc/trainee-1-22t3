# trainee-1-22t3

This repo contains Trainee 1's roadtrip planning app. For the MVP we are aiming to allow passengers to be distributed between each driver, minimising distance/driving time from each driver.

The app will use a React frontend and Flask backend.

## Backend

To start the backend, clone the repo and create a virtual environment using the command `python3 -m venv env`.

Next, start the virtual environment with `source env/bin/activate`.

Then, install the required packages with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

Finally, start the Flask server with `flask --app roadtrip --debug run`. Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000 to see the app in action!
